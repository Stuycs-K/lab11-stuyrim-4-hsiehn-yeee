| Special Attack | "Sunburn": Sunflowers emanate a bright light, decreasing the opponentâ€™s special by 25% while also dropping their own by 10%.|"Withering": The Chomper spits out acid around it, dealing 14-its current pH level and gaining 3 pH (pH must be lower than 7)|"Horde": The Zombie sets out 2-4 brains, luring its zombie friends to come and help it. The zombies attack the opponents, dealing 3 * 2 to 3 * 4 damage (# of zombies lured* 3) |
| Support | "Vitamin D": The ally eats two sunflowers, shielding them from the next attack, while the sunflowers take 2 damage.|"Blooming": The Chomper spits out a glob of acid, restoring 1 special or 1 HP depending on which one is lower.|"CS Test": *If ally is a Zombie:* The Zombie proctors a computer science test for its ally, forcing it to get smarter and gain 3 brains. *If ally is not a Zombie:* The Zombie uses the test as compost, giving its ally 1 special.|

| Special Attack | "Apocalypse": The Zomboss commands a horde of 8-10 zombies, dealing 2 damage per each zombie and losing 8-10 musclePower. Zombies are careless when they fight, so they damage the Zomboss as well, dealing 1-5 damage to the Zomboss. (musclePower must be greater than 25)|
